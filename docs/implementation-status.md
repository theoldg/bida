# Implementation status

*For: an agent starting a cold session. The state of the project in one screen,
and the next thing to do. Everything here is a pointer — the doc that owns a
subject describes it, and this file says only where the project stands against
it. Update it in the same commit as the code it describes.*

## Where it stands

**Every phase is closed** (2026-09-05). The MVP shipped, then eight more phases
did; scanning was the last feature in. What is not built was cut rather than
queued — receipt photo storage, CSV export and categories are seams in
[product.md](product.md#deliberately-not-in-the-mvp), not work in progress.
[roadmap.md](roadmap.md) has the phase-by-phase record.

**Live** at <https://hajsik.hajsik-api.workers.dev> — one Worker serving the
static export *and* the sync API, backed by the `hajsik` D1 database
([hosting.md](hosting.md)). Verified against production, not just locally:
idempotent push, pull, a wrong secret refused, and a real group synced between
two devices.

## The next action

**[invariants.md](invariants.md)** — the only open work, and it is one subject:
invariants the UI checks at write time that a merge can break anyway. Four are
open there, and the owner has settled the direction for three of them — merge an
entry whole rather than per field, make a member's name their identity and
forbid renaming, and let a phone whose member was removed settle it on sync.
Each removes more than it adds; none is built.

Start with the whole-entity merge: the other two sit on it, and its two
amendments (lifecycle fields stay per-field, history diffs by re-folding) are
what keep a stale write from undoing a repair. Nothing else is scheduled — a
session with no assignment should take that, not start a feature the owner cut.

## What a cold session needs to know

The app is a shared-expense ledger with no accounts: a group is a secret link,
every change is an appended op, and money is integer minor units. The five
non-negotiables in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md#non-negotiables) are the ones worth
reading twice; past that, go to the doc for your task —
[docs/README.md](README.md) is the index.

Three things surprise people who assume otherwise, so they are worth naming
here before you read anything:

- **What a foreign amount is worth belongs to the group, not the entry.** One
  rate per currency, synced as an op; `atCurrentRates` values the whole ledger
  in one pass where state is read, so correcting a rate moves every entry
  already written in that currency ([ADR-0005](decisions/0005-money-and-currency.md)).
- **An edit writes only what the edit changed.** The form posts every field and
  the command layer diffs them, so two phones editing different fields of one
  expense offline both keep their change
  ([sync.md](sync.md#the-operation)).
- **History is read, never rewound.** The `restore` op kind still folds only
  because production groups hold some
  ([ADR-0031](decisions/0031-history-reads-it-does-not-rewind-it.md)).
